I am a Solution Architect at [EY](https://www.ey.com/en_au "EY") and [Microsoft MVP (AI)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003464?fullName=Arafat%20Tehsin "Microsoft MVP (AI)"). I have more than a decade of software development experience with the specialisation on digital transformation and business automation.

I love to code, write and talk about Microsoft AI stack that includes everything around Applied and Generative AI, Cognitive Services, ML Frameworks & .NET and Power Platform. I am very passionate about empowering developers of all the stacks with the necessary AI skills.

- 💻 I am currently working on some exciting stuff around [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/ "Azure AI") and a bit of [.NET](https://dot.net) and [Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/ "Power Platform")
- 🚀 I recently created a Generative AI repo where I've shared two fresh notebooks (Azure OpenAI and Semantic Kernel)  to help you get started with the [Generative AI](https://github.com/arafattehsin/generative-ai)
- 🚗 To tackle the complex problems and with the advent of the intelligent vision capabilities of GPT-Turbo with Vision, I recently created [ParkingGPT](https://github.com/arafattehsin/ParkingGPT). Check out the motivation and the reason behind it on my [blog](https://arafattehsin.com/parkinggpt-your-ai-parking-copilot/)
- 📱 I also created a cross-platform app [GuessWhat?](https://arafattehsin.com/build-your-ai-first-apps-with-semantic-kernel/) which is an end to end implementation of an AI First app built using Semantic Kernel and .NET MAUI  
- 📈 I created a small yet fast [SentimentAnalyzer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SentimentAnalyzer/) library built on ML.NET for developers to incorporate within their .NET solutions, be it mobile apps, IoT devices or websites. If you're participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), please check out the [issues](https://github.com/arafattehsin/SentimentAnalyzer/issues/1) tab and grab the first enhancement to mark your first PR! 
- 🎒 I'm a part of the Microsoft Learning Hub initiative and you can always join my [AI for Everyone](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=LvPJtBfa7U2clc6do48l2XKuB66ZZD5LoteW1KtocHdURUdORjdEMzI5TVY5TjYySVdWVjZBU0FaOS4u) room. I'm trying to cater everyone with different skillsets to learn AI. 
- ⚙ My repo [CognitiveRocket](https://github.com/arafattehsin/CognitiveRocket) contains all of the stuff I talk or blog about. 
- ✍ Lately, I have written some [blogs](http://arafattehsin.com/blog "blogs"), guides to create awesome AI experiences for your customers along with an [AI For Every Developer](http://www.arafattehsin.com/tag/ai-for-every-developer/ "AI For Every Developer") series.
- 📚 These days, I am running a [Global AI Podcast](https://globalai.live/ai-the-podcast/ "Global AI Podcast") & learning about the [latest capabilities](https://news.microsoft.com/build-2023-book-of-news/) that were released during [Microsoft Build 2023](https://build.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft Build 2023")
- 🤖 Along with other MVPs, I co-founded and maintain the [Bot Builder Community](http://github.com/botbuildercommunity "Bot Builder Community Project") to facilitate Microsoft Bot Framework enthusiasts. It's becoming a legacy but we'll see where it goes.
- 👯 If you have got anything exciting around Azure AI, .NET, Power Platform then I am always up for it
- 💬 Please feel free to ask me anything around Conversational AI, Azure and Power Platform development
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I am not working or helping anyone, I am either spending a quality time with my family or capturing nature (💡 [Instagram](http://instagram.com/arafattehsin "instagram"))
