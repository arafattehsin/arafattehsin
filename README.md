I am a Founder of [Fedorai](https://www.fedorai.com/") and [Microsoft MVP (AI)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003464?fullName=Arafat%20Tehsin "Microsoft MVP (AI)"). I have more than a decade of AI development experience with the specialisation on digital transformation and business automation.

I love to code, write and talk about Microsoft AI stack that includes everything around Applied and Generative AI, Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Services, ML Frameworks & .NET along side bit of Power Platform. I am very passionate about empowering developers of all the stacks with the necessary AI skills.

- 💻 I am currently working on some exciting stuff around [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/ "Azure AI") and a bit of [.NET](https://dot.net) with [Business Applications ecosystem](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/ "Power Platform")
- 🧑‍🏫 I am also startup advisors for a few startups associated with Microsoft for Startups as well as one of the fastest growing Microsoft Partner, [ITKnocks](https://itknocks.com)
- 🚀 I recently created a Generative AI repo which I continuously fill in with all things AI goodness, primarily to help you get started with the [Generative AI](https://github.com/arafattehsin/generative-ai) as well as build sophisticated Agentic AI solutions for your customers
- 🚗 To tackle the complex problems and with the advent of the intelligent vision capabilities of GPT-4o, I recently created [ParkingGPT](https://github.com/arafattehsin/ParkingGPT). Check out the motivation and the reason behind it on my [blog](https://arafattehsin.com/parkinggpt-your-ai-parking-copilot/)
- 📱 I also created a cross-platform app [GuessWhat?](https://arafattehsin.com/build-your-ai-first-apps-with-semantic-kernel/) which is an end to end implementation of an AI First app built using Semantic Kernel and .NET MAUI  
- 📈 I created a small yet fast [SentimentAnalyzer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SentimentAnalyzer/) library built on ML.NET for developers to incorporate within their .NET solutions, be it mobile apps, IoT devices or websites. If you're participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), please check out the [issues](https://github.com/arafattehsin/SentimentAnalyzer/issues/1) tab and grab the first enhancement to mark your first PR! 
- ✍ Lately, I have written some [blogs](http://arafattehsin.com/blog "blogs"), guides to create awesome AI experiences for your customers along with an [AI For Every Developer](http://www.arafattehsin.com/tag/ai-for-every-developer/ "AI For Every Developer") series.
- 📚 These days, I am running a [Global AI Podcast](https://globalai.live/ai-the-podcast/ "Global AI Podcast") & learning about the latest capabilities around Azure AI Foundry
- 👯 If you have got anything exciting around Azure AI and .NET then I am always up for it
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I am not working or helping anyone, I am either spending a quality time with my family or capturing nature (💡 [Instagram](http://instagram.com/arafattehsin "instagram"))
