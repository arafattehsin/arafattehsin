I am a Solution Architect at [EY](https://www.ey.com/en_au "EY") and [Microsoft MVP (AI)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003464?fullName=Arafat%20Tehsin "Microsoft MVP (AI)"). I have around a decade of software development experience with the specialization on digital transformation and business automation.

I love to code, write and talk about Microsoft AI stack that includes everything around Bots, Cognitive Services, ML.NET & Power Platform / D365. I am very passionate about empowering developers of all the stacks with the necessary applied AI skills.

- üíª I am currently working on some exciting stuff around [Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/ "Power Platform") and [Azure AI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/ "Azure AI")
- ü§ñ Along with other MVPs, I co-founded and maintain the [Bot Builder Community](http://github.com/botbuildercommunity "Bot Builder Community Project") to facilitate Microsoft Bot Framework enthusiasts
- üìà I created a small yet fast [SentimentAnalyzer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SentimentAnalyzer/) library built on ML.NET for developers to incorporate within their .NET solutions, be it mobile apps, IoT devices or websites. If you're participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), please check out the [issues](https://github.com/arafattehsin/SentimentAnalyzer/issues/1) tab and grab the first enhancement to mark your first PR! 
- ‚öô My repo [CognitiveRocket](https://github.com/arafattehsin/CognitiveRocket) contains all of the stuff I talk or blog about. 
- ‚úç Lately, I have written some [blogs](http://arafattehsin.com/blog "blogs"), guides to create awesome AI experiences for your customers along with an [AI For Every Developer](http://www.arafattehsin.com/tag/ai-for-every-developer/ "AI For Every Developer") series.
- üìö These days, I am running a [Global AI Podcast](https://globalai.live/ai-the-podcast/ "Global AI Podcast") & learning about the [latest capabilities](https://news.microsoft.com/build-2021-book-of-news/) that were released during [Microsoft Build 2021](https://build.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft Build 2021")
- üëØ If you have got anything exciting around Power Platform, Bots, ML.NET or Azure AI, then I am always up for it
- üí¨ Please feel free to ask me anything around Conversational AI, Azure and Power Platform development
- ‚ö° Fun fact: When I am not working or helping anyone, I am either spending a quality time with my family or capturing nature (üí° [Instagram](http://instagram.com/arafattehsin "instagram"))
